(*) we need to do a study for 
(*) lila_query could be used to do pictures, or mayb we do the pictures in matlab? or maybe we do both
(*) lila_param can be used for profiling
(*) do a study for the computation of Q
(*) maybe do a study for the computation of T
(*) explain that LAPACK recomputes, try to write the __ same recursive code with LAPACK kernels __
(*) explain that the next step is the blocking in the m dimension, right now focusing on iterative methods, so column mind set
(*) how do we go about breaking the space in t em dimension? Do we reconstruct? Do we have layers of small T? Or do we go for a big T? How can we keep being elegenat?
(*) explain that the next step is MGS

(*) explain the overall design of the software

(*) next step is n=1 and full T and lag

(*) send an email to Almadena for funding of all this great ideas



(*) Do a flop query as well
(*) Create all separate routines for each test function
