(*) we need to do a study for 
(*) lila_query could be used to do pictures, or mayb we do the pictures in matlab? or maybe we do both
(*) lila_param can be used for profiling
(*) do a study for the computation of Q
(*) maybe do a study for the computation of T
(*) explain that LAPACK recomputes, try to write the __ same recursive code with LAPACK kernels __
(*) explain that the next step is the blocking in the m dimension, right now focusing on iterative methods, so column mind set
(*) how do we go about breaking the space in t em dimension? Do we reconstruct? Do we have layers of small T? Or do we go for a big T? How can we keep being elegenat?
(*) explain that the next step is MGS

(*) explain the overall design of the software

(*) send an email to Almadena for funding of all this great ideas

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

(*) Next step is n=1 and full T and lag
(*) Do a flop query as well

(*) Get levelx working in ../src
(*) Transfer all the (sub) mains over to ../src  ---- ? (not sure exactly if a certain format is needed or just copy over the mains and add them in the include)
(*) t03 needs working outside -leaf 0 and -panel 0 -leaf 0? (I have it working in all excecpt for within lila_dgeqr2_3.c
	if so I need to work on this
(*) Construct all new lila_query for workspace (might as well do flops during this as well)
