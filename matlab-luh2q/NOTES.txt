* software paper on the new subroutines
  - present the interface, design choices
  - present the test suite
  - present three ways to program the code
    o one block of columns at a time
    o many levels of blocking
    o recursive code for QR factorization
  - present also the cons and pros of the new approach with timing experiments
  - comparison with state of the arts
    o it can be said that everything we have been doing can be done with LAPACK by rewriting the code
    o internal blocking in 
  - main feature of the new Householder QR fatorization suite
    o limited blocking with mt
    o compact representation "that extends naturally" no matter
  - consquences of these features
