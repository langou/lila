* software paper on the new subroutines

  - present the interface, design choices

  - present the test suite

  - present three ways to program the code

    o one block of columns at a time

    o many levels of blocking

    o recursive code for QR factorization

  - present also the cons and pros of the new approach with timing experiments

  - comparison with state of the arts

    o LAPACK

      ^ it can be said that everything we have been doing can be done with LAPACK by rewriting the code

      ^ since LAPACK recompute T at each call of each subrroutines, it is very easy for LAPACK to change the NB to 

      ^ coupling of the algorithmic block size, with the user block size

    o internal blocking in PLASMA

      ^ kind of a similar idea where there is two levels of blocking (NB and IB), however we ``connect`` the IB together
        so that many NB are compatible. This is a key idea to enable ``many levels of blocking`` (as opposed to only two)
        the facilty in PLASMA design is that the lowest level of block (IB) is MT.
        we break this facility with our software
        the main idea is that MT is not the lowest level of blocking, but the highest.
        we can block above MT and below MT.

    o recursive of paper of Gustavson

      ^ the main structure is about the same

      ^ we are adding the mt to limit the number of flops

      ^ and we are able to break the recusion in three ways, four ways, etc. instead of limiting with a recursion that divides by 2

  - main feature of the new Householder QR fatorization suite

    o limited blocking with mt

    o we pass the T in all of our subroutines (as opposed to recompute it)

    o compact representation "that extends naturally" no matter

  - consequences of these features

    o decoupling of the algorithmic block size, with the user block size

    o we can do re

  - extensions (list of things we plan on doing, one day)

    o 1D data distribution and with MPI

    o MGS and the T matrix of MGS

  - extensions (list of things we dream on doing but will not)

    o Given V, T1 and mt1 and a new mt2, give the corresponding T2 (reusing information in T1)

    o French and Wise explain how to do 

* paper on Householder reconstruction

  - code the Householder reconstruction of Demmel

  - study the reconstruction quality as a function of the quality of Q + proof

  - two applications

    o use CholeskyQR to construct Q, then reconstruct to get V (and H and T), then apply V (block Gram-Schmidt process)

    o write a ``better`` [Q1,R1] = qrinsert(Q,R,n+1,X,'col') subroutines where X is a block of vectors

    o try to break other block Gram-Schmidt algorithm
