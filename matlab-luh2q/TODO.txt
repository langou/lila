* write (5) unit test suite for 
    1. lila_geqrf_v05
    2. lila_ormqrf_v05
    3. lila_larft_v05
    4. lila_larft_connect_v05
    5. lila_ormqrbz_v05

* write (3) example-of-use codes 
    1. one block of columns at a time
    2. many levels of blocking
    3. recursive code for QR factorization

* write each of the (5) codes (3) times:
    1. one column at a time
    2. full T
    3. with mt

* start saving FLOPS for each of the (15) codes
    1. each of the (15) codes

* convert matlab syntax to C syntax but stay in matlab, 
    1. each of the (15) codes
    2. each of the unit test code
    3. each of the demo code

* convert the codes to C, each of the (15) codes
    1. each of the (15) codes
    2. each of the unit test code
    3. each of the demo code

* write a suite of code that only computes A/T first, then compute, then another suite that computes
  A/Q/T at once

* write an LAPACK based code for qrinsert, write the LAPACK code that would do this

* count the FLOPS, in particular for QR and Full T and [ A, Q, T ] 
  do we save FLOPS?

* time the code, release the code, write a paper

( Julien can, maybe, clean up the manylevels code and have it recursive . . .)
