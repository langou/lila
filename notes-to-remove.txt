Think about the pop for MGS, MGS basically runs Householder in the small world
so that it never have to push and pop. Is that it?  Can we use this insight to
do something about it? 


How do get from Q to V in the one vector case? This is pretty easy. And i think this explains LU.
Think about the

Work on this LARFT that improves stability 
what matters is
how ``H * ( I in small world)`` so H is orthogonal.
And then look at representatiity
plot in term of condition number

Gustavson proposes to do ( A, T ). We propose ( A, T and Q ).


change interface for A,ia,ja, B,ib,jb
